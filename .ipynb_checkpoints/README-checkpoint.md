# Course-DataScience

I am studying Data Science by the course of Professor Ivanovitch Silva at UFRN. This course stays in [Ivanovitch's Github](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/datascience_one_2019_1.git). My plan is while I am studying and solving the lessons. I will put it here. So I will observe my progressive in the course!
