    "In this lesson, we learned how to transform data using the **Series.map()**, **Series.apply()**, **DataFrame.apply()**, and **DataFrame.applymap()** methods along with the **pd.melt()** function.

    "As you explore pandas, you'll also find that pandas has a method to **\"un-melt\"** the data, or **transform rows into columns**. This method is called the [df.pivot()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html) method, not to be confused with the **df.pivot_table()** method used to aggregate data. Alhtough we couldn't cover the **df.pivot()** method explicitly in this lesson, we encourage you to explore it on your own.\n",
